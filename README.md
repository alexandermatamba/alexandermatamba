I am a sixth-semester student majoring in Systems and Computer Engineering, and I am passionate about software development with a clear focus on backend development.

I have experience working on educational projects at my university and personal projects where I was responsible for developing business logic on the backend using Java and Python. I implemented Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), data structures, algorithms, recursion, database management, APIs, and ensured an efficient and secure data flow to create robust and efficient backends.

Furthermore, I have knowledge in frontend development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React to create interactive user experiences, and I am skilled in DevOps to effectively manage development and application deployment infrastructure.
